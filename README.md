# PHYDOTax
Thank you for visiting. Here you will find the spectral libraries and code to run the phytoplankton functional type algorithm "Phytoplankton Detection with Optics" or PHYDOTax (Palacios, 2012). PHYDOTax uses a matrix math approach to find representative phytoplankton spectral end-members from a spectrum of a natural mixture of phytoplankton. PHYDOTax can be fine-tuned to a region's phytoplankton taxa and so it is a conceptual approach that can be applied nearly anywhere.

For a thorough explanation of algorithm development and application, the user is advised to read Palacios 2012 (Chapter 3) and McKibben et al. (in prep) respectively.
