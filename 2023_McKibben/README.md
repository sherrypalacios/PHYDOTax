# PHYDOTax 2023 McKibben

Here you will find data files and code in support of McKibben et al. 2023. Code and spectral libraries are included to run the phytoplankton functional type algorithm "Phytoplankton Detection with Optics" or PHYDOTax (Palacios, 2012) in this repository are a Python version of the original MATLAB code by Palacios 2012.

For a thorough explanation of algorithm development and application, the user is advised to read Palacios 2012 (Chapter 3) and McKibben et al. (in prep) respectively.
