# PHYDOTax 2023 McKibben

Here you will find a Python version of the MATLAB PHYDOTax code originally developed by Palacios 2012. Contents of 2023_McKibben are in support of the McKibben et al. 2023 manuscript. Specifically provided are the code and spectral libraries necessary to run the phytoplankton functional type algorithm "Phytoplankton Detection with Optics" or PHYDOTax (Palacios, 2012), as well as the field and synthetic data tested in McKibben et al. 2023. 

For a thorough explanation of algorithm development and application, the user is advised to read Palacios 2012 (Chapter 3) and McKibben et al. (in prep) respectively.
